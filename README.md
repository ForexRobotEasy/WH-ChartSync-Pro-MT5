# WH ChartSync Pro MT5

WH ChartSync Pro MT5 is a Forex trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to perform real-time synchronization of charts in the MetaTrader 5 platform. This allows traders to analyze the Forex market using advanced algorithms and make trading decisions based on the analysis.

## How it works

The code provided in this repository is a sample implementation of the WH ChartSync Pro MT5 robot. It utilizes the Trade and ChartObjects libraries to enable real-time chart synchronization and perform market analysis.

The expert initialization function, `OnInit()`, enables real-time synchronization of charts using the `ChartSetInteger()` function. This ensures that all charts in the platform are synchronized and updated simultaneously.

The expert deinitialization function, `OnDeinit()`, disables real-time synchronization of charts when the expert is removed or the platform is closed.

The expert tick function, `OnTick()`, is called on every tick of the market. It retrieves the current symbol and timeframe of the chart and performs market analysis using the `PerformMarketAnalysis()` function. Based on the analysis result, a trading decision is made to either open a buy trade or a sell trade using the `trade.Buy()` or `trade.Sell()` functions respectively.

The `PerformMarketAnalysis()` function is where the advanced analysis logic should be implemented. In this sample code, a fixed analysis result of 0.5 is returned as a placeholder. Traders should replace this with their own market analysis algorithm.
